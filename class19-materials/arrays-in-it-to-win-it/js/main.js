//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movies = ['Movie1', 'Movie2', 'Movie3']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const firstMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const length = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const lastMovie = movies[-1]
